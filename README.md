# Gen1Pokemon
A practice ontology for the first generation of Pokemon.

This is an ontology I made for the first generation of Pokemon as a way to learn about semantic web technology, especially OWL and RDF. It was made using Protégé.

Triples were added to the ontology using the spreadsheet and transformation rules in the repo via the Cellfie plugin.

This was my first attempt at making an ontology, so there are already many things that I would change! For a more recent example of an ontology, check out my repository for the boardgame Agricola!
